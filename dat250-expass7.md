**Technical Problems**: Was a bit hard to understand how to get rabbitmq to work properly.
And was challanging to get the programs to run from command line, as I did the project on eclipse and it automaticly added a package for every class.
So I had to run the programs from parent directory(expass7) and declare the jar file in the specific child folder which was different for every tutorial, and then use the package declaration of a class to run it.
So it was a bit of a hassle to bet it to work. But I got it working properly and as intended in the end ðŸ˜Š

**Pending Issues**: None that I can think of ðŸ¤”
