I allready had java JDK and IDE installed from prevoius courses, so I didn't have to install them again :)
I had no problems installing Maven and Git client on my windows machine, everything went smoothly.
I followed Heroku "Getting started on Heroku with Java" tutorial and I had no problems. I installed the extra addons decribed in the tutorial (papertrail, PostgressSql)
