I encountered only an issue when I only added the derby.jar, eclipselink.jar and jakarta.persistence_2.2.3.jar into lib folder and I got the error couldn't find Embedded driver. So I had to also add derbyshared.jar and derbytools.jar into my lib folder

I just printed out the contents of tables into the console :) Picture in expass2 repository

No pending issue. Atleast that I can think of :)
